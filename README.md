# PostEditor and Post CRUD with Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.23.

I also used angular-in-memory-web-api as fake server,

and used [JavaScript post edit methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Editable_content/Rich-Text_Editing_in_Mozilla).
